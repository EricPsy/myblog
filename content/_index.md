Hi！ My name is He Chen, a fitness enthusiast who obsessed with CrossFit and functional training over the past few years. I also enjoy reading nonfiction and watching anime.

Right now, I work as a data analyst at an e-commerce company, handling business analysis and BI-related tasks. Recently, I've developed an interest in AI, especially large language models. I started this blog to capture my random thoughts and bits of life—so I don’t lose track of things as time flies by.

Hi! 我是陈和，一个爱健身的I人，目前居住在杭州。我特别喜欢crossfit训练和类似的体能训练，也喜欢阅读(非虚构类)和看动漫。

我目前是一位数据分析师，在电商公司做业务分析和BI相关内容。写博客是想记录下自己的日常思考和生活碎片，以免回首千重山。
