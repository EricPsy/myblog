Hi！ My name is He Chen, a fitness enthusiast who also happens to be an introvert. Yes, we do exist!  I've gotten really into CrossFit and functional training over the past few years—I'm obsessed with it.  And, I totally admire people with artistic talent. My guitar teacher, on the other hand, is losing hope in me ever figuring out basic chords like 1-2-3-4-5. 😅

Right now, I work as a data analyst at an e-commerce company, handling business analysis and BI-related tasks. Recently, I've developed an interest in AI, especially large language models. In my leisure time, I enjoy reading nonfiction, watching anime, and, of course, working out. I started this blog to capture my random thoughts and bits of life—so I don’t lose track of things as time flies by.

Hi! 我是陈和，一个爱健身的I人，目前居住在杭州。我最近几年喜欢上了crossfit训练和类似的体能训练，他们帮助我保持很好的精力来应对工作和日常生活的琐事事件，也是压力很好地释放方式。

我目前是一位数据分析师，在电商公司做业务分析和BI相关内容。业余时间我喜欢阅读一些非虚构类书籍、看动漫，当然还有运动。写博客是想记录下自己的日常思考和生活碎片，以免回首千重山。
